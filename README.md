## Description

> Quart is a Python ASGI web microframework.
> It is intended to provide the easiest way to use asyncio functionality in a web context, especially with existing Flask apps.
> This is possible as the Quart API is a superset of the Flask API.

As I wanted to seamlessly migrate from Flask to Quart and noticed, that there are a few issues in using [Flask-Compress](https://github.com/shengulong/flask-compress) together with Quart, I decided to create my own Quart-Compress packages, which is based on the Flask-Compress project.
